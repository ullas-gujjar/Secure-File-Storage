Developed a secure web-based file storage and sharing system using AES and RSA encryption to protect user data. Used a password-based key derivation (KDF) method to generate strong encryption keys from user passwords. Implemented secure file upload, encryption, decryption, role-based login, and Gmail notifications to ensure data safety and user privacy.
